# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This project is a work day scheduler that allows a user to create events throughout the current day and save them locally for future reference. This project was built to demonstrate the capabilities of CSS Bootstrap, Jquery, Jquery UI, and moment.js libraries. 

## Procedure and Challenges

This project began with provided starter code that included the heading and some CSS classes. I began with writing a function in javascript using moment.js to show the date and time in the header. While not in the project specifications, I included to time as it will help identify what hour the scheduler should display currently.

Next, I hard-coded the container with all the time blocks and added times from 9 AM to 9 PM. The project specifications require only this much, but I imagine it would be more efficient to generate these
